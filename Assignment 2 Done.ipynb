    "# TMA4215 - Assignment 2 - Conjugate Gradient and ODEs\n",
    "\n",
    "**Deadline:** Wednesday September 23, 11:59PM.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment you will implement the Preconditioned Conjugate Gradient (PCG) method.\n",
    "Then there are some small theoretical questions on Numerical ODEs.\n",
    "\n",
    "**PCG algorithm.** Implementations of the (P)CG algorithm can be found in many libraries, but here you are supposed to implement your own code for solving $Ax=b$ by PCG. Here we shall assume that the matrix $A$ is implemented by means of a function, say *A_func(v)* that for any vector $v$ returns $Av$. Similarly, we implement the preconditioner also as a function *Precond(v)* that returns $P^{-1}v$ for any vector $v$. An popular alternative to this approach is to use sparse representation of matrices, (see e.g. *scipy.sparse*), but we shall not use that here.\n",
    "\n",
    "You are of course allowed to use the obvious built-in functions for elementary operations, such as computing inner products, norms etc. We will provide the function *A_func(v)* to be used in this assignment. Your job is to implement a function *PCG* whose template you find below, a function *Precond(v)* that implements some iterations of the Gauss-Jacobi splitting method as preconditioner, and finally a small main programme that generates the results.\n",

    "2. the right hand side *b* of the system $A\\cdot x = b$ (numpy array)\n",
    "3. The initial guess *x0*\n",
    "4. *tol*, a tolerance used to define the stopping criterion\n",
    "5. *Precond* which is a function that takes a vector $v$ as input and returns $P^{-1}v$ for the preconditioner $P$.\n",
    "\n",
    "There should be 3 output arguments: \n",
    "1. the computed solution $x$, \n",
    "2. the residual after the last iteration, $r$ \n",
    "3. the number of iterations *iter* needed to meet the stopping criterion \n",
